- Memory allocation techniques
- Pointers and references
- Member pointers
- Switch statements

**Key Concepts:**

- Dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`)
- Pointers to members
- References and reference variables
- Switch-case control structures

- Managing dynamic memory for individual objects

### ex02 ‚Äì Zombie Horde

**Objective:**  
Develop a program that creates a horde of zombies and manages their lifecycle.

**Key Learnings:**

- Managing arrays of objects
- Dynamic memory allocation for arrays

### ex03 ‚Äì Pointer to Member Function

**Objective:**  
Implement a program that demonstrates the use of pointers to member functions.

**Key Learnings:**
